The mDirac Mex extension
========================
Marc Joliet <marcec@gmx.de>

mDirac is a mex wrapper for the time-stretching/pitch-shifting C++ library
DiracLE (version 2), written by Stephan Bernsee of
http://www.dspdimension.com[DSP Dimension].

Introduction
------------

mDirac is a simple Mex wrapper for the time-stretching/pitch-shifting library
DiracLE (version 2).  It works with Matlab arrays of arbitrary MxN dimension, M
being the number of samples per channel and N being the number of channels, as
returned by, e.g., 'wavread()'.

This Mex file started out as part of a university assignment, but I considered
it useful enough to warrant a release on its own.

Features
--------

mDirac supports all parameters of DiracLE 2.  It should be considered feature
complete in the sense that all features of DiracLE are wrapped by the mDirac Mex
file.

Apart from that, there is also a special function intended solely for time-stretching,
"TimeStretchDirac", that takes care of some of the specifics of DiracLE (e.g.,
automatically resampling to sampling rates that are supported by Dirac).  Its
existence is due to a requirement of the university assignment that this project
came from.
